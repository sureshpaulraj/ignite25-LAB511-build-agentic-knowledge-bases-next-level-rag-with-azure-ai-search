    "- `KnowledgeRetrievalMinimalReasoningEffort` prioritizes speed and cost savings over advanced reasoning\n",
    "- `EXTRACTIVE_DATA` output mode returns raw chunks instead of synthesized answers\n",
    "- `KnowledgeRetrievalSemanticIntent` structures queries as focused search intents rather than conversational messages\n",
    "- No Azure OpenAI model required in the knowledge base configuration, reducing baseline costs\n",
