### Session Description

In this hands-on lab, you’ll build a Knowledge Base using agentic RAG, the next evolution of retrieval in Azure AI Search. Connect your agentic retrieval engine to your data through smart source selection across multiple indexes and storage systems. Learn how to enhance planning using natural language guidance and generate grounded responses with citations or extractive answers tailored to your use case. By the end, you’ll have a fully functional Agentic Knowledge Base responds over enterprise data.

### 🧠 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this session, learners will be able to:

- Design and build a Knowledge Base that uses agentic RAG to retrieve, reason, and respond over enterprise data.
- Implement smart source selection to connect and query multiple indexes and data sources intelligently.
- Use natural language guidance to enhance query planning and generate grounded, citation-rich, or extractive responses tailored to business needs.
